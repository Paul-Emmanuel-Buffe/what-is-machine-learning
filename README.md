# What is Machine Learning?

## Project context

This project is an introductory research work focused on understanding the fundamentals of **machine learning** and **data science**. It is designed for educational purposes and aims to clarify key concepts that are essential before starting practical machine learning projects.

Machine learning is a core component of artificial intelligence. It allows machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed, by using statistical models and algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions. These techniques are widely used in many fields such as healthcare, finance, and decision support systems.

Before working on real-world machine learning applications, it is important to understand the theoretical foundations that support them. This repository gathers definitions, explanations, illustrations, and reliable sources to build a solid base of knowledge.

## Objectives

* Understand the main concepts of data science and machine learning
* Distinguish between supervised and unsupervised learning
* Learn the basics of classification, regression, and model evaluation
* Provide clear explanations intended for other learners

## Content

This repository documents the following topics:

* Data science
* Machine learning and deep learning
* Supervised and unsupervised learning
* Classification and regression
* Model evaluation concepts (cross-validation, cost function, gradient descent, etc.)

Some concepts are explained in more detail and illustrated to help other learners better understand them.

## Format

The documentation is written in Markdown and hosted on GitHub.
All definitions are based on documented and reliable sources.
